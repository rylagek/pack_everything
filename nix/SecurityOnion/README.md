# Security Onion VirtualBox Builds

## List of builds

 - **security-onion-base.virtualbox-iso.base**: The base installation with none of the tools intalled on top of it
 - **so-eval.virtualbox-ovf.eval**: An evaluation install. This includes just enough to show off capabilities, but is not meant as a production system
 - **security-onion-standalone.virtualbox-ovf.so-standalone**: A complete standalone system (manager + sensor + search all-in-one). Meant for small networks only, does not scale well
 - **security-onion-mgr-sch.virtualbox-ovf.so-mgr-sch**: A combined manager-search build meant for distributed systems

## Base Install

To build just the base, run:

`packer build -only security-onion-base.virtualbox-iso.base packer`

This will generate an OVF with a relatively standard CentOS installation. It is the equivalent of starting the SecurityOnion iso and just going through the first part of the installation (until the first reboot)

## Other Installs

These all build off of the OVF generated by the base install, so even if you are building just one of these you will have to have run the base at least once. Having the base installation prevents having to do the same thing over again for each of the builds.

## Customizing/Changing settings

The settings I have set up will most likely not be sufficient for production. To change things like networking setup and credentials, you'll have to change the settings in the scripts: `scripts/ucwt-*-iso` depending on the version you're installing
